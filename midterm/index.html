                            “Everything we do, and everything we ever can do in designing and building equipment, is simply to ‘unlock’ what nature has already put into this little bean.”

                        <p>
                            This same message is the ethos of Sodoi. All the skills we have, all the efforts we make, are in the service of revealing the essence of what creation has built into each unique coffee.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            From our green buyer, to roast-master, to every brewer and server, and through everyone on the Sodoi team, including our customers, we are saying to each bean we roast and each brew we serve – Come on little bean, tell the truth, open your heart, love your life, and be the delicious coffee you can be.
                        </p>

					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>Similarly to the last article, I feel like I overlooked accessibility as something that designers think about. I learned more about how people who have different disabilities can be affected by your design choices and what decisions to make about color to allow their experience to be better.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>I liked the section where it showed us a visual of what to do and what not to do because it helped put into perspective why these choices are more helpful.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "That statistic alone is reason enough to design for accessibility."</p>
						</li>
					</ul>

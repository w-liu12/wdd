						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>I learned about fonts and how different fonts serve different purposes to harmoize with the whole project. I also didn't know specific fonts appeal to/work better for children which was pretty interesting. I also never put much thought into font pairings because many websites use multiple types of fonts so it was interesting to hear how designers choose. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part was the different examples they gave of font pairings because I could see how the principles they were talking about were bring used in a real design. The designs themselves were very pleasing to the eye and it made me wanna learn how to create like that as well. It also helped me grasp the differet font and sizes better. </p>

						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>Something I didn't really think too much about were the four gestalt principles. I think I've seen them in different designs but I never thought about them being purposefully used in design to capture a certain idea. I thought Reification was the most interesting since it shows how cool the brain really is to be able to fill those gaps in information and form assumptions so strong that we don't even realize it's an assumption.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part was the continuation factor. I would think that items that are arranged in a harsh line would be more related than ones in a more organic form but it's not the case. I liked that it challenged views I assumed. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> When Similarity occurs, an object can get emphasised by being different from the rest; this is called ‘Anomaly’ and can be used to create contrast or visual weight. It can draw the user’s attention to a specific piece of content (focal point) while assisting with scanability, discoverability and the overall flow. </p>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<div class="body-header">Feedback</div>

					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I didn't know that the human brain would think that an animation over 1second would be slow since 1 second seems so fast. It's interesting that there is an optimal amount of time for animations and I never thought about how that would affect the UX of something. It's even more interesting that the amount of optimal time varies depending on what device you're on because I would assume that it's the same but a different sized screen affecting it never really crossed my mind either. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part was them showing us with different animations why certain choices regarding timing and use of animations is how it is. It was cool to be able to visualize how much of a difference it makes. The one were lists of items showing up I really felt slight irritation when the items in the "bad" section didn't pop up as quick.</p>

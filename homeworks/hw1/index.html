    <a href="https://webdesigndecal.github.io/">Cool Website</a>
    <ul>
        <li>I learned that many websites/apps use a lot of different design ways to catch our eyes or make us feel a certain way when experiencing their website. It's pretty cool that small details like wording or what things are put in view can affect so much!</li>
        <li>My favorite was the part that talks about things to keep in mind when scrolling through websites or apps. It'll definitely give me a new perspective on things that are highlighted or spacing or intention of a website</li>
        <li>" By routinely analyzing other apps, youâ€™ll develop your product thinking and get better at designing apps yourself."        </li>
        <li>10 it was cool</li>

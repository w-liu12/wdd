                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p>I learned that dynamic websites/apps can be very engaging and pleasing. I was always a little intimidated by them because sometimes the movement can be too much but these have very nicely pleasing movements. I realized how important movement in the website is for user experience.</p>

                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p>I liked that there weren't words. The designs speak for themselves and regardless of words, I could tell what it was meant to showcase. The less words needed for explanation, the better the design.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> I really liked the credit cards display because I like how the cards wiggle as they scroll. I also liked how the boxes shrunk to give way to the nav bar. The animations give me a sense of nice and intuitive design. It showed me intuitively how the pages were changing and gave the website a feeling of cohesiveness.</p>
